Understanding the business problem

As the client deals with automobile products especially for 2 wheelers,they have multiple service centers
but there is gap between what is demand in service center and production units.

Here we have to build a machine learning model which will predict the demand of particluar spare parts in
particular center so that gap between demand and supply can be maintained.


General hypothesis 

Hypothesis1:There will be increase in demand as the year pass by.
Explaination:-Since the population is increasing and growing so we can expect rising demand in coming years.


Hypothesis2:There is specific month/time when we can expect rise in demand.
Explaination:-In the months of rainy seasons some automobile parts gets prone to demage.They requires replacement
               or repair.

Hypothesis3:There is specific products which has more demands than usaul products.
Explaination:-There are some products like self starters which has high chances to get damage during rainy and
               winter seasons.

Hypothesis4:The demand of spare parts are regional
Explaination:-Due to natural calamities there is chance that demand at the region is 0 but after everthing settles
              we can expect demands.

Hypothesis5:-The demand is more during weekends.
Explaination:-On weekdays generally people will have offices,works so we can expect demands durinf weekends.
